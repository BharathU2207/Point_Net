# Point Net
A Point-Net implementation from scratch using PyTorch with open3d visualization. This repository contains an implementation of PointNet from scratch, inspired by the [original PointNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593) by Charles R. Qi et al. The project covers classification and segmentation tasks, showcasing the power of PointNet in processing 3D point cloud data.
