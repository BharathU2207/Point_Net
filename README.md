# PointNet from Scratch
This repository contains an implementation of PointNet from scratch, inspired by the [original PointNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593) by Charles R. Qi et al. The project covers classification and segmentation tasks, showcasing the power of PointNet in processing 3D point cloud data. The project includes two notebooks:

- PointNet_architecture_from_Scratch.ipynb

  - Implements the PointNet architecture from the ground up, following the original paper.

- pointnet-classification_and_segmentation.ipynb

  - Uses the implemented architecture to train a PointNet model for classification and segmentation.
  - Trained on the ShapeNet Core Benchmark dataset.
